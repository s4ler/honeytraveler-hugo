## About HoneyTraveler
HoneyTraveler explores the world of honey, bees, and the traditions that connect them.  
It began as a research and storytelling project, cataloging honeys from every region and flora —
from the high forests of Europe to the tropical apiaries of Africa and the Pacific.

This staging site demonstrates the new **Hugo + Cloudflare** architecture and serves as a model
for structured, content-first publishing.

narrative: |
  The chestnut tree belongs to the same family as beeches and oaks. For thousands of years 
  the chestnut was a primary source of nutrition in the mountainous areas of the Mediterranean 
  where grains did not grow well. The primary honey-producer, the sweet chestnut tree 
  (Castanea sativa) is common in Europe where it was introduced from Sardis (in what is now Turkey) 
  thousands of years ago -- hence the name "Sardinian Nut", now known simply as the chestnut.

  Although not a nectar-producer, the American Chestnut (Castanea dentata), a native species 
  of the United States, once grew so densely it was said a squirrel could jump from tree to tree 
  without once touching the ground between New York State and Georgia. In an ecological disaster, 
  close to four billion trees in the Eastern United States were wiped out in the early 1900s by a blight. 
  Efforts to create a hybrid resistant to the blight are ongoing. Fortunately the Sweet Chestnut has 
  shown resistance to the blight and as a happy consequence we are able to enjoy chestnut honey 
  from these nectar-producing trees.

  Chestnut honey has a strong aromatic taste and a slightly bitter after-taste. Rich in pollen content, 
  mineral salts and tannin, with a high proportion of fructose that resists crystallisation and a 
  relatively low acidity. Dark in colour, ranging from yellowish brown to almost black, sometimes 
  with amber hues. Aromatic with a pungent herbal aroma and slightly tannic; the flavour is unique, 
  not very sweet, slightly bitter, and very persistent -- highly appreciated by those who like a 
  strong, less sweet honey. Blossoms from May to June.

  It is excellent with aged cheeses (Stracchino, Ricotta) or hearty meat dishes. Or try it the Tuscan 
  way: drizzled over a piece of Pecorino Toscano with fresh pears.

  Of the common species of Chestnut trees, the Sweet Chestnut (Castanea sativa) grown mainly 
  in Europe produces honey, and the Allegheny Chinkapin (C. pumila) grown in Eastern USA produces 
  a strong and bitter honey. In Asia, the Japanese Chestnut (C. crenata) grown mainly in South Korea 
  is a source of honey. The Chinese Chestnut (C. mollissima), Henry Chinkapin (C. henryi), and 
  Sequin (C. seguinii) are grown in China and may be sources of honey.

  Two chestnuts are not members of the same family at all: the Horse Chestnut or Conkers 
  (Aesculus hippocastanum), not edible and growing across the temperate world, and Water Chestnuts, 
  an aquatic vegetable grown in China (Family Cyperaceae).

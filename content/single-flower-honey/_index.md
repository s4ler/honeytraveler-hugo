narrative: |
  Single-flower (monofloral) honeys are those in which the nectar comes predominantly from one botanical source. 
  These honeys reveal the unique flavor, aroma, and terroir of the flower from which they originate, offering an 
  extraordinary way to explore landscapes, seasons, and cultural traditions through taste.

  Around the world, beekeepers seek specific floral blooms—from acacia to chestnut, citrus, thyme, linden, and 
  high-mountain wildflowers—each producing a honey with its own identity. These honeys are shaped not only by the flower 
  itself, but by soil type, climate, elevation, and the presence of companion plants and forest species.

  This section collects the world’s major single-flower honeys, providing each with its own dedicated page that 
  includes botanical notes, flavor profiles, global terroir mapping, food pairings, cultural history, and traditional uses.

  As the HoneyTraveler project continues, each monofloral honey page will be expanded with deeper research, regional 
  comparisons, chemical markers, pollen signatures, and producer insights.

# Single-Flower Honeys

Single-flower honeys (also known as *monofloral honeys*) are produced when bees gather the majority of their nectar 
from one primary botanical source. These honeys express the **distinct identity of a flower**, capturing its flavor, 
aroma, and the terroir of the landscape where it grows.

Explore the growing collection of monofloral honeys below. Each honey has its own page containing:

- Botanical & floral notes  
- Geographic & terroir influences  
- Flavor and texture profile  
- Food pairings & culinary uses  
- Cultural and historic notes  
- Optional health/traditional uses  
- Internal cross-links to related honeys and regional pages  

As more honeys are added, this section will become the central reference hub for monofloral honey knowledge.

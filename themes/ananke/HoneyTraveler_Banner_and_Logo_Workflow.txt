HoneyTraveler Banner & Logo Workflow
Version 1.1 – Linearity Curve Integration
(Replaces Vectr-based plan)

🎯 Purpose
Create, refine, and export the HoneyTraveler logo and main site banner using Linearity Curve (iPad free plan) and integrate finished assets into the Hugo site (/static/images/brand/).

🪜 Step 1 – Finalize Base Design in Looka
1. Open Looka → adjust font, kerning, color until balanced.
2. Export two versions:
   • HoneyTraveler_Logo_Base.svg (vector)
   • HoneyTraveler_Logo_Base.png (for reference)
3. Save both to /HoneyTraveler_Website/4_Tech_Theme/brand_assets/source/.

🪜 Step 2 – Import into Linearity Curve
1. Launch Linearity Curve → + New Document (2000 × 800 px for banner layout).
2. Tap “+ → Import → Files” and select the Looka SVG or PNG.
3. Rename the layer “Logo.”
4. Optional – add new text layer for tagline (Travel, Taste, Tradition).

🪜 Step 3 – Tidy and Align
• Use the Align tools to center logo and text.
• In the Inspector, set font, letter-spacing, and color.
• Rename layers for clarity: Logo, Text, Background.
• Lock layers not being edited to avoid accidental moves.

🪜 Step 4 – Export Assets
Vector (Web use):
1. Share → Export → SVG → “Optimized for Web.”
2. Name logo.svg.
3. Save to /HoneyTraveler_Website/4_Tech_Theme/static/images/brand/.

Raster (Banner image):
1. Share → Export → PNG (width 2000 px, transparent background).
2. Name banner@2x.png.
3. Save to same brand folder.

🪜 Step 5 – Integrate into Hugo
Edit front matter of /content/_index.md or site config:

title: "HoneyTraveler"
banner: "/images/brand/banner@2x.png"
logo: "/images/brand/logo.svg"

Hugo automatically pulls these from /static/images/brand/.

🪜 Step 6 – Version & Archive
• Keep each major revision (V1, V2, etc.) inside /brand_assets/versions/.
• Add a note in the HoneyTraveler Tech Log when new art is adopted for staging.

🪄 Optional Enhancements (when comfortable)
• Use the Pen Tool (P) only for fine curve adjustments.
• Define HoneyTraveler color palette (e.g., Gold #E1AD01, Dark Brown #3B2F2F).
• Add subtle drop shadow under text if needed for banner contrast.
